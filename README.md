# How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
A: The design of our software starts with a vision of the end-user experience. For the 3D workspace scene, this meant creating an immersive and interactive environment that mimics a real-world study area. We honed new design skills, particularly in 3D modeling and realistic texture mapping, to ensure that each object from the provided image - the desk, chair, lamp, and bookshelves - was both aesthetically faithful and served a purpose within the scene. The design process was iterative; we began with low-fidelity models and gradually added detail, guided by user feedback and technical constraints. These tactics, especially the iterative nature of our design process, will be invaluable for future projects, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in our workflow.
# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
A: Our development approach is meticulous and user-centric. We introduced new strategies in this project, such as physics-based rendering for realistic lighting and shadow effects. Iteration was a key theme in development; we continuously refined our code, enhancing performance and interactivity with each review cycle. Throughout the project milestones, our development approach evolved to place a higher emphasis on code modularity and readability, which proved crucial for maintaining a complex 3D environment.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
A: Computer science is the backbone of our project, enabling us to create a virtual environment that can be used for educational or professional simulations. Through computational graphics and visualizations, we've gained knowledge in 3D design and user interaction that will be directly applicable to future educational endeavors, such as creating virtual labs or educational games. Professionally, these skills open doors to careers in software development, game design, and virtual reality - fields that are becoming increasingly relevant in the digital age.
